Hi! I'm currently a postbac fellow at the National Library of Medicine (NLM), NIH. My research interests are ML, NLP, and information retrieval e.g. document retrieval, dense retrieval, document representation, etc. In the next few years, I plan on starting my PhD studies as well as doing research internships.
