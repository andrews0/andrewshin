Hi! I'm currently a research fellow at the National Library of Medicine (NLM/NIH). My interests are information retrieval, bioNLP, scholarly document processing, AI for healthcare, HCI, and ethics. I hope to begin my PhD and do research internships in the next few years. I was awarded the NSF graduate fellowship – CSGrad4US – that provides funding and mentorship for PhD studies.
