Hi! I'm currently a research fellow at the National Library of Medicine (NLM/NIH). My interests include information retrieval, bioNLP, AI for healthcare, scholarly document processing, scientific document retrieval, representation learning, ML, ethics, and HCI. I hope to begin my PhD and do research internships in the next few years. I've been awarded a NSF graduate fellowship – CSGrad4US – which provides funding for PhD studies in CISE fields. I have a BA in philosophy from UC Santa Barbara. Feel free to reach me at ashleyhshin at gmail dot com :)
