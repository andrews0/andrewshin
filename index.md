Hi! I'm currently a research fellow at the National Library of Medicine (NLM/NIH). My interests include information retrieval, bioNLP, scholarly document processing, AI for healthcare, HCI, and ethics. I hope to begin my PhD and do research internships in the next few years. I am a recipient of the NSF graduate fellowship CSGrad4US, which provides funding for PhD studies in CISE fields. I have a BA in philosophy from UC Santa Barbara.
