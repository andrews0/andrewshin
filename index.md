Hi!! I'm currently a research fellow at the National Library of Medicine (NLM/NIH). My interests include information retrieval, embedding models, representation learning, scholarly document processing, recommender systems, biomedical NLP, AI for healthcare, ML, ethics, and HCI. I'll begin PhD studies in computer science this fall. I've been awarded a NSF graduate fellowship – CSGrad4US – which provides funding for PhD studies in computational fields. I studied philosophy at UC Santa Barbara. Feel free to reach me at ashleyhshin at gmail dot com :)
