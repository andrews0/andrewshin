Hi!! I'm a first year PhD student at UC San Diego, advised by Julian McAuley. My interests include information retrieval, recommender systems, embedding models, representation learning, scholarly document processing, biomedical natural language processing, AI for healthcare, machine learning, ethics, HCI. I'm currently working on dense retrieval and text embedding models for scientific document retrieval. I've been awarded a NSF graduate research fellowship.
